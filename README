--------
Abstract
--------

POE::Component::Client::Traceroute is an asynchronous, event driven client
for UDP or ICMP traceroutes. It accepts events containing the specifics of
a traceroute request and it returns, on either a per hop basis or at the end,
the results of the traceroute.

------------
Requirements
------------

This module requires POE. It also requires root privileges, or the equivalent,
to open raw sockets. Any hazards of doing this are left up to the implementor
to work around. 

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

POE::Component::Client::Traceroute may be installed through the CPAN shell
in the usual CPAN shell manner. This typically is:
    
    $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install POE::Component::Client::Traceroute'

You can also read this README from the CPAN shell:

    $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
    cpan> readme POE::Component::Client::Traceroute

And you can install the module from the CPAN prompt as well:

    cpan> install POE::Component::Client::Traceroute

-------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------

POE::Component::Client::Traceroute can also be installed manually.
<ftp://ftp-mirror.internap.com/pub/CPAN/authors/id/A/AH/AHOYING/> or a similarly
named directory at your favorite CPAN mirror should hold the latest version.

Downloading and unpacking the distribution are left up to the reader.

To build and test it:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test

The test program, t/01_trace.t, makes an excellent sample program. It was
adapted from the code used to test and develop this module. There may be
additional sample programs in the examples folder.

When you are ready to install the module:

    make install

It should be ready to use.

This module is supported by the author on an ad-hoc basis. Please try the
